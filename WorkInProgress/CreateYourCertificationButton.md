Create your certification button

Simply create an “Add to profile” button and place it in your emails and website. With a single click, your users can add their certificates to their LinkedIn profiles.

\2. New: How to create a button that directs users to a pre-filled form on their LinkedIn profiles

Certificate recipients will no longer need to manually fill out their certificates. Instead, you can create a link that will automatically pre-fill the certificate form, similar to the one below:

<img src="C:\Workspace\bootcamps\ProjetoDIO_LinkedinCompartilhamento\WorkInProgress\Image/Pre-filled-form.png.original.png" alt="Linkeddin_AddCertificate" style="zoom:80%;" />

This is a great approach if you want to save your certificate recipients’ time and add a level of customization behind your button. Below are the custom fields that you can pre-fill.

For illustration purposes, we’ll create an example button with the dummy values listed in the table below. Please note that all of these fields are optional and whatever fields you choose to pre-fill will be automatically populated when users click on the link you create.

| **Information**   | **Description**                                              | **Dummy Value**                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| name              | What you want the Certificate to be named                    | Test Certificate                                  |
| organizationId*   | Your organization ID (if your organization has an existing page on LinkedIn) | 1337                                              |
| organizationName* | Your organization name (if your organization doesn’t have an existing page on LinkedIn) | LinkedIn                                          |
| issueYear         | Year the certificate was issued                              | 2018                                              |
| issueMonth        | Month the certificate was issued                             | 2                                                 |
| expirationYear    | Year the certificate expires                                 | 2020                                              |
| expirationMonth   | Month the certificate expires                                | 5                                                 |
| certId            | Certificate ID                                               | 1234                                              |
| certUrl           | Credential URL                                               | https://www.linkedin.com/path/to/certificate/1234 |

*When defining your custom fields, please pick between ‘organizationId’ and ‘organizationName’. The two cannot be included at the same time. If your organization has an existing page on LinkedIn, we recommend you use the ‘organizationId’ field. If your organization does not have an existing page on LinkedIn, please use the ‘organizationName’ field instead.

**2a. Create a link for users to directly add your Certification to their profiles**

The bolded text below should be modified according to your own custom information.


If you choose to include ‘organizationId’, create a URL using the following format:

https://www.linkedin.com/profile/add?startTask=CERTIFICATION_NAME&name=**Test%20Certificate**&organizationId=**1337**&issueYear=**2018**&
issueMonth=**2**&expirationYear=**2020**&expirationMonth=**5**&certUrl=**https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com
%2Fen-us%2Flearn%2Fcertifications%2Fd365-functional-consultant-sales**&certId=**1234**

If you choose to include ‘organizationName’, create a URL using the following format:


https://www.linkedin.com/profile/add?startTask=CERTIFICATION_NAME&name=**Test%20Certificate**&organizationName=**LinkedIn**&issueYear
=**2018**&issueMonth=**2**&expirationYear=**2020**&expirationMonth=**5**&certUrl=**https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.
microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flearn%2Fcertifications%2Fd365-functional-consultant-sales**&certId=**1234**

**2b. Build a “Add to profile” button into your emails or website**

Note that the bolded text below should be modified according to the link you created above

<div><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/add?startTask=CERTIFICATION_NAME&name=Test%20Certificate&organizationId=1337&issueYear=2018&issueMonth=2&expirationYear=2020&expirationMonth=5&certUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flearn%2Fcertifications%2Fd365-functional-consultant-sales&certId=1234"><img src="https://download.linkedin.com/desktop/add2profile/buttons/en_US.png " alt="LinkedIn Add to Profile button"></a></div>

[FAQs](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/61169?query=add to profile&src=direct%2Fnone&veh=direct%2Fnone)

We have recently made some changes to our Add to Profile functionality, which will impact how third-party information is populated into fields on a LinkedIn member’s profile. 

Specifically, if a member wants to add certificate or degree fields to their profile, they can continue to do so using the “Add to Profile” flow; however, it will no longer autofill. Members will have to enter the relevant information directly on their profile. 

Developers who implement Add To Profile can now use a static URL to generate their button. Links will no longer be customized for a specific certificate or degree. After clicking “Add To Profile,” users will be directed to a profile form where they can fill out the details of their certificate or degree. Existing customized buttons will continue to work, but they will now direct to the new experience without auto-filling certificate or degree information.
