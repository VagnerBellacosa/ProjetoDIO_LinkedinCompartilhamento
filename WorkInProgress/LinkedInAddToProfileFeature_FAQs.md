# LinkedIn Add to Profile Feature - FAQs

Last updated: 3 months ago

**Add to Profile** allows you to easily add professional certifications and education degrees to your profile. Simply click **Add to Profile** and enter the information as prompted. The certification and degree information doesn't autofill, but you can add the relevant information directly.

Learn more about [adding or updating a certification](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/44644) and [updating the education section](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/381) on your profile.

**For certification or degree providers:**

If you are a certification provider with a Page for a company or school, you can create your LinkedIn Add to Profile buttons and links on the [LinkedIn Add to Profile microsite](https://addtoprofile.linkedin.com/). You can include the Add to Profile button or link in your emails, websites, and social media posts. The Add to Profile button is available in 19 languages.

What information can I include in my Add to Profile button?

We’ve recently made some changes to our **Add to Profile** functionality, which will impact how third-party information is populated into fields on a LinkedIn member’s profile.

Specifically, if a member wants to add certification or degree fields to their profile, they can continue to do so using the Add to Profile button. However, it will no longer autofill and members must enter the relevant information directly on their profile.

Developers who implement Add to Profile can now use a static URL to generate their button. Links will no longer be customized for a specific certificate or degree. After clicking Add to Profile, users will be directed to a profile form where they can fill out the details of their certificate or degree. Existing customized buttons will continue to work, but they’ll now direct to the new experience without auto-filling certificate or degree information.

Can I create multiple buttons for the same program?

Yes, you can create as many buttons as you need.

Moving forward, you'll be provided with a static URL to generate your button. Links will no longer be customized for a specific certificate/degree. When a user clicks Add to profile, they'll be directed to a profile form where they can fill out the details of their certification or degree. Existing customized buttons will continue to work, but will direct to the new experience without auto-filling certificate or degree information.

Can I have a different logo for certifications?

The Add to Profile program currently uses only the logo featured on your Page. If you want to show a different logo for a certification, [create a Page for your certification](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/710). To see an example of this, check out [Coursera Verified Certificates](https://linkedin.com/company/coursera-verified), and the [LinkedIn Page for Coursera](https://linkedin.com/company/coursera-verified).

What if the user is not signed up to LinkedIn when they click my Add to Profile button?

If a member doesn't have a LinkedIn profile and clicks the Add to Profile button, they'll be taken to a signup page where they can join LinkedIn. The member can then enter the relevant information and add the degree/certificates to their LinkedIn profiles within same flow, as auto-fill will no longer be available.

How can I edit or change my Add to Profile button?

You can't edit an existing button, but you can create a new one. We don't automatically do anything on our end with the buttons you create.

If you make a mistake on a button, don't distribute that link or button. Just visit the [Add to Profile](https://addtoprofile.linkedin.com/) page again and create a new one.

Does it cost anything to create a button? Is there an approval process?

[Add to Profile](https://addtoprofile.linkedin.com/) is free to any company or school that has a [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/28406). There's no approval process required. You can create your button immediately and implement it right away.

How can a college or university access metrics about their alumni on LinkedIn?

When graduates add your school to their profile, they automatically begin following your [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/28406). If you go to your Page, click the **Alumni** tab to explore where they work and what they do.

We also have a large array of free tools that help universities prepare students for careers, engage alumni, and assist with marketing and admissions outreach. Learn more about them on [LinkedIn's higher education page](https://university.linkedin.com/) and a [summary of LinkedIn's data and tools](https://university.linkedin.com/higher-ed-professionals).

Can we promote the short link on places like Twitter and Facebook?

Yes, you can use the short link on all types of social media or blog forums.

Do I need to be an Admin of the Page to create the button?

No, you don't need to be the [LinkedIn Page Admin](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/4783) to create an Add to Profile button. You might want to get in touch with your Admin after you create the button, though. They may be able to help you determine how many new followers your Page gets after you launch your button.
